Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     There is a life beyond the Number 2 pencil.  It  is worth getting some good quality drawing  pencils at an arts and craft store.      The softer the pencil, the darker the value you  will be able to achieve.      Ebony is a very satisfactory pencil to  use.  There is no number associated with  this pencil, but it is approximately  equivalent to a No. 5 pencil.      Look for pencils designated with 4B, 5B and  6B.      For a big difference from your  everyday 2H pencil, start with the   6B pencil.        Experiment with the pencils.    VALUE  — SHADES OF GRAY  2  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     •  Make a rectangle and divide it into four  squares.      •  Create a rectangle for each different  pencil you have.      •  Shade the first square as lightly as you  can.      Holding the pencil in the middle  and lightly will help you not to  press.      •  Now shade the last square as dark as your  pencil will allow.  You will need to do  layer over layer.    •  Next, create two more values between the  lightest and darkest.      VALUE EXERCISE  3  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L.

Most of us, before  educated awareness, only work within a  narrow range.      You will find that even the lowly 2H pencil  will enable you to expand your horizons.    4  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     •  Draw one continuous line with one of  your pencils.  Start very lightly; continue  with greater pressure, until your line is as  dark as possible within the limitations of  your tool.  Repeat this with each of your  pencils, noticing the potential of each.    •  Draw the same straight line, but this time  start with the point of the pencil at the  light end of your new line.  Slowly tip  your pencil as you press continuously  harder; by the time you reach the end of  the line you will be using some of the side  of the pencil for a broader and darker  line.    •  Try this again, making a wavy line this  time.  Try to create a wider line when you  dip down and a thinner one when your  pencil reaches the top of the wave.        LINE EXERCISE  5  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L.

Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     By making a series of lines placed closely next  to one another you can create a value over a  broad area.  Directionality will be a choice  that you will make when you use this  technique in context.      To create a denser value you can overlap  series of parallel lines.                                HATCHING AND CROSS-HATCHING  8  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Try these out for yourself on a full sheet of  paper.  Give yourself some room to play.       Start with the four directions shown at the  top of the page.      Copy each in a column three more times.        After you have done this, you will overlap on  each hatching in the other three directions,  ending up with a sheet full of various cross- hatchings.      HATCHING EXERCISE  9  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Lines have directionality.  Use it to your  advantage to suggest information about your  subject.  THE COMBINATIONS  10  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Hatching does not have to be parallel.    Try tapering off the density by letting up on  the pencil for a lighter line.          NON-PARALLEL HATCHING  11  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved       The value can be made lighter by making the  lines farther apart.                        12  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Use variations of hatching to indicate various  textures and planes.      The bricks can be made to appear flat or  protruding, darker and lighter, recessed in  one area more than another by using various  combinations and concentrations of  hatchings.      HATCHING FOR TEXTU RES AND PLANES  13  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved   In the brick well notice the direction of the  hatching for the top of the bricks, the surface  of which is parallel to the ground.        The vertical lines in the bricks facing us  indicate a vertical surface.      14  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved   The two hexagonal prisms also show how  hatching can be used to indicate volume.                                            HATCHING FOR VOLUME  15  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved       Contour hatching is used for rounded figures.   One of the ways to build up the illusion of  roundedness is to hatch with parallel lines  that “go around” the figure by curving.      See Volume lesson for  more examples of  contour hatchings on  cylinders.        Vincent Van Gogh was a master at using pen  and ink to sculpt his subjects.  It is worth  taking some time to look at his drawings.      They are almost schematic in nature.      CONTOUR HATCHING  16  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Scumbling and stippling differ from hatching  by their lack of directionality, which can be  an advantage for certain subjects.  This  technique can be used when you wish to avoid  sharp edges.  Clouds, smoke, and bushes seen  from a distance are some examples of subjects  that would lend themselves to this technique.      Scumbling is the building up of tone with  curlicues, around and around.        SCUMBLING AND STIPPLING  17  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     Stippling is the use of dots or small spots to  build up tone.                            Artists from late 19 th  century France, calling  themselves Pointillists, are the most famous  practitioners of this technique in painting.        Look up George Seurat and be sure to find a  book that shows details of his paintings.      18  Basics:  Pencil Technique    Copyright ©2005-2006 by Richard L. Yepez and Kathleen E. Yepez.  All Rights Reserved     In time you will discover the use of new  variations of stroke in response to what you  see.    The next three pages have examples of trees,  each with its own personality.      The goal was to capture the movement,  texture and shapes created by the tree, both  positive and negative.    These were done quickly and are a lot of fun  to do.        Try some, blurring your eyes and looking.      You can never draw each leaf.      You always have choices of what you select to  record.
